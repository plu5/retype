Getting started
===============

To run retype, you can `download the latest build for your operating system <https://github.com/plu5/retype/releases/latest>`_, :doc:`build it yourself <build-instructions>`, or :doc:`run it from sources <running-from-sources>`.

When you launch the application, you should see 5 epub books that it comes with of short classic works. You can begin reading one of them by clicking on its cover or entering ``>load #`` into the console, where ``#`` is the numerical id of the book which can be seen above the cover.

Type to progress through the book. You can see your current speed in words per minute on the graph above the modeline and your personal best.

Other than typing, you can navigate the book with toolbar buttons and console commands.

You can add more library search paths and customise retypeâ€™s operation in the Customisation Dialog, which can be accessed from the menu or by :kbd:`Ctrl+O`.
